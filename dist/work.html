                    I worked on a mobile application which seeks to digitize the social status of New York's nightclubs.
                    The application is built in React-Native and Expo, and the backend uses Google Firebase. I worked on
                    a team with 2 other developers, and my main responsibility is configuring the application for a
                    standalone Android build. We would meet bi-weekly with the design committee and the social media
                    team to make sure all teams are aware of the other teams' progress, as well as plan the next steps
                    in the developement process.

                    I worked in several four man teams to build full stack applications like City Flocks and
                    Books-a-Lot. We employed the Agile methodology to plan work sprints and maintain consistent
                    workflow, while coding was done mostly using pair programming to maintain clean and efficient
                    code. My main responsibility in these teams was the development of the server-side code and
                    setting up the deployment of the applications.

                    I was responsible for relaying and sending the to-go orders of an inner city restaurant that served
                    at least on average 500 delivery orders a day. I received the orders using multiple ordering
                    applications such as GrubHub and Postmates, and managed the workflow between kitchen and delivery
                    staff to ensure customers recived their orders in a timely manner.

                    I had to prepare multiple food items for a company that served at least 300 dine-in daily orders. My
                    responsibility was to prepare ingredients and ensure proper quality for use by teppanyaki and sushi
                    chefs, as well as cook side dishes such as rice, soup, and salad. I cycled through multiple
                    positions such as dishwashing, delivery, and bussing to suit the ever-changing demands of the
                    company.
